-nested if-else is if having another if-else block inside it
 
 
*example  
if(age>=18)
      if(hasDrivingLicense)
        console.log("Can Drive");
      else
     console.log("Can't Drive");
else
     console.log("Can't Drive");

*Point to be Noted
-it is not compulsory to have else at the end of the if-else ladder;
-if any else-if is proved true in ladeer than all outher else-if will get get terminated;
